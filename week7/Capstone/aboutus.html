        <p>I'm a Dominican native who's been living in the US since 2013. <br>
           In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family. One of my favorite<br>
           pastime is to take pictures and walking near the lake.<br>
           We like to visit new places for vacation. We enjoy learning about different<br>
           cultures and trying new dishes as a family.
        </p> 
        <p>Quilting, reading and swimming, are also among the things I enjoy<br>
           the most. Coding was always I dream I had. I never thought I could learn<br>
           to write codes and to develop web pages. It's been a challenge, but<br>
           a fun one! I've learned many other things on this journey and I love<br>
           being part of this great community of web developers.
